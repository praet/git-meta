git-meta 0.1
Usage:  git-meta [ COMMAND ] [ META_FILE ]

git-meta tracks useful metadata of git-versioned files as well as the
folders they reside in, using a merge-friendly metadata storage format.

Currently the following types of metadata are stored:
- Modification time (as seconds since Epoch)
- User ownership (user name, not UID)
- Group ownership (group name, not GID)
- Access rights (in octal)

Metadata info is read and written from/to a file called ``.gitmeta''
in the root of the repo's working tree, though most commands (the ones
for which it makes sense) can be provided with an alternate filename.


COMMANDS:
  p, print         print metadata to standard output
  v, validate      validate a metadata file
  d, diff          compare current metadata to a metadata file
  s, save          save current metadata to a metadata file
  r, restore       restore metadata from a metadata file

  -h, --help       display this help and exit
  -v, --version    output version information and exit
